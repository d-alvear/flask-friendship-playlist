                  <li class="blockquote-li" style="width: 480px;"><b>Danceability</b>: how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength
                      and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable, and 1.0 is most danceable.</li>
                  <li class="blockquote-li"><b>Energy</b>: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic 
                      tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. </li>
                  <li class="blockquote-li"><b>Tempo</b>: the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace 
                      of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. </li>
                  <li class="blockquote-li"><b>Valence</b>: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound 
                      more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>

              <h3><b>How To Interpret This Plot:</b></h3>
                  <p style="width: 620px; text-align: justify;">This grouped violin plot compares the audio features of of both friends songs. The box plot inside the violin shows how the features of 
                      both friends' songs are distributed, while the curve of the violin represents the probability of all songs in the genre taking on the associated feature value.
                      In other words, if each friend picked a fourth song, there is a higher probability the fourth song will take on a value where the violin is widest,
                      and a lower probability of their song having a value where the violin is the skinniest. These probabilities can be seen by hovering over the violin and 
                      seeing how the <b>kernel density estimate (kde)</b> changes as you move along the violin.
